<title>Tarltons Iest of a red face.</title>

<lg>
<l>To an Ordinary in the White Friers, where Gen-</l>
<l>tlemen used, by reason of extraordinarie dyet, to </l>
<l>this Tarlton often frequented, as well to continue </l>
<l>acquaintaince, as to please his appetite: it chanced</l> 
<l>>so upon a time (especially) being set amongst the Gentlemen</l> 
<l>and Gallants, they enquired of him why melancholy had</l>
<l>got the upper-hand of his mirth, to which he said little, but</l> 
<l>with a squint eie, as custom had made him hare eied, he lookt</l> 
<l>for a Jest to make them merry; at last he espyed one that sate</l> 
<l>>on his left side, which had a very red face, hee being a very</l> 
<l>great Gentleman (which was all one to Tarlton) he present-</l>
<l>ly in greast hast called his Hoast: who so I serue my Hoast?</l> 
<l>of the house: how happens it then quoth Tarlton, that to her</l> 
<l>>Maiesties disgrace, you dare make me a companion with</l> 
<l>Seruingmen, clapping my Lord Shandoyes <!--Cullisance?--> up-</l>
<l>>on my sleeue, looking at the Gentleman with the red face,</l> 
<l>me thinks quoth he, it fits like the Sarazens head without</l> 
<l>Newgate: the Gentlemans Salamanders face burnt like</l> 
<l>Aetna for anger, the rest laughed heartily: in the end all in-</l>
<l>raged, the Gentleman swore to fight with him at the next</l> 
<l>meeting.</l>
</lg>


<title>A sodaine and dangerous fray, twixt a Gentleman and 
Tarlton, which he put off with a Iest.</title>
<lg>
<l>As Tarlton &amp; others passed along Fleetstreet, hee espied</l>
<l>a spruce yong gallant, blacke of complecion, with long </l>
<l>haire hanging downe ouer his eares, and his beard of the </l>
<l>Italian </l>
<l>Italian cut, in white Satten, very quaintly cut, and his </l>
<l>body so stiffe starcht, that he could not bend himselfe any </l>
<l>way for no gold: Tarlton, seeing such a wonder comming, </l>
<l>trips before him, and meeting this gallant tooke the wall of </l>
<l>him, knowing that one so proud, at least looked for the pre-</l>
<l>rogatiue. The gallant (conning that a Player should take </l>
<l>the wall, or so much indignitie him, turned himselfe, and pre-</l>
<l>sently drew his Rapier, Tarlton Drew likewise: The Gen-</l>
<l>tleman fell to it roundly, but Tarlton in his owne defence, </l>
<l>compassing and trauersing his ground, gaped with a wide </l>
<l>mouth, whereat the people laughed: the Gentleman pau-</l>
<l>sing, enquired why he gaped so? I Sir saies he, in hope to </l>
<l>swallow you, for by my troth, you seeme to me like a prune </l>
<l>in a [Messe] of white Broth: at this the people parted them, </l>
<l>the Gentleman noting his mad humour, went his way </l>
<l>well contented, for he knew not how to amend it.</l>
</lg>

<title>Tarltons Iest of a Pippin.</title>
<lg>
<l>At the Bull in Bishopsgate street, where the Queenes </l>
<l>Plaiers oftentimes played: Tarlton comming on the </l>
<l>Stage, one from the Gallerie threw a Pippin at him, Tarl-</l>
<l>ton tooke up the Pip, &amp; looking on it made this sodaine iest.</l>
<l>Pip in or nose in, chuse you whether,</l>
<l>Put yours in, ere I put in the other:</l>
<l>Pippin, you haue put in, then for my grace,</l>
<l>Would I might put your nose in another place.</l>
</lg>

<title>A Iest of an Apple hitting Tarlton on the face. </title>
<lg>
<l>Tarlton hauing flouted the fellow for his Pippin which </l>
<l>he threw, he thought to be meet with Tarlton at length, </l>
<l>so in the Play Tarltons part was to trauell, who kneeling </l>
<l>downe to aske his Father blessing: the fellow threwe an </l>
<l>Apple at him, which hit him on the cheeke: Tarlton taking </l>
<l>up the Apple made this Jest.</l>
<l>Gentlemen</l>
	<l>Gentlemen, this fellow with his face of Mapple.</l>
    <l>Instead of a Pippin hath throwne me an Apple:</l>
    <l>But as for an Apple he hath cast a Crab,</l>
    <l>So instead of an honest woman God hath sent him a Drab.</l>
<l></l>
<l>The people laughed heartily, for he had a Queane to his </l>
<l>Wife.</l>
</lg>
					
<title>How Tarlton and one in the Gallerie fell out. </title>
<lg>
<l>It chanced that in the midst of a Play, after long expecta-</l>
<l>tion for Tarlton, (being much desired of the people) at </l>
<l>length he came forth: where at his entrance, one in the gal-</l>
<l>lerie pointed his finger at him, saying to a friend that had </l>
<l>neuer seene him, that is he: Tarlton to make sport at the least </l>
<l>occasion giuen him, and seeing the man point with one fin-</l>
<l>ger, he in loue against held up two fingers: the captious fel-</l>
<l>low iealous of his wife (for he was maried) and because a </l>
<l>Player did it, tooke the matter most hainously, and askt him </l>
<l>why hee made Hornes at him: No quoth Tarlton, they be </l>
<l>fingers:</l>
<l>    For there is no man which in loue to mee</l>
<l>    Lends me one finger, but he shall haue three.</l>
<l></l>    
<l>No, no, sayes the fellow, you gaue me the hornes: true saies</l> 
<l>Tarlton, for my fingers are tipt with nailes which are like </l>
<l>hornes, and I must make a shew of that which you are sure </l>
<l>of: this matter grew so, that the more he medled, the more </l>
<l>it was for his disgrace: wherefore the standers by coun-</l>
<l>selled him to depart, both he and his hornes, lest his cause</l> 
<l>grew desperate: so the poore fellow plucking his hat ouer </l>
<l>his eyes, went his wayes.</l>
</lg>
	
<title>How Fiddlers fidled away Tarltons apparell. </title>
<lg>
<l>It chanced that one Fancie and Nancie, a Musition (?) in </l>
<l>London, used often with theyir Boyes to visite Tarlton, when </l>
<l>he dwelt in Gracious-street, at the signe of the Saba, </l>
<l>a</l> 
<l>a Tauern, he being one of their best friends or benefactors, </l>
<l>by reason of old acquaintance: to requite which, they came </l>
<l>one summers morning to play him the Hunts up with such </l>
<l>Musicke as they had: Tarlton, to requite them would open </l>
<l>his Chamber doore, and for their paines would giue them </l>
<l>Muskadine: which a Cony-catcher noting, and seeing Tarl-</l>
<l>ton come foorth in his shirt and sight-gowne to drinke </l>
<l>with these Musitions, the while this nimble fellow slept in, </l>
<l>and tooke Tarltons apparell which euery day he wore, thin-</l>
<l>king that if he were espied to turne it to a iest, but it past for </l>
<l>currant and he goes his waies: Not long after Tarlton re-</l>
<l>turned to his Chamber, and looked for his clothes, but they </l>
<l>were safe enough from him. The next day this was noy-</l>
<l>sed abroad, and one in the mockage threw him this Theam, </l>
<l>he playing then at the Curtaine.</l>
<l></l>
<l>Tarlton I will tell thee a iest,</l>
<l>Which after turned to earnest:</l>
<l>One there was as I heard say,</l>
<l>Who in his shirt heard Musicke play,</l>
<l>While all his clothes were stolne away.</l>
<l></l>
<l>Tarlton smiling at this, answered on the sudden thus:</l>
<l></l>
<l>That's certaine, Sir, it is no lye,</l>
<l>That same one in truth was I:</l>
<l>When shall I haue cloathes to my backe:</l>
<l>And I together with my fellowes,</l>
<l>May see him ride to Tiburne Gallowes.</l>
</lg>
					
<title>Of Tarlton and a Begger.</title>
<lg>
<l>There was a poore Begger (but a conceited fellow) who </l>
<l>seeing Tarlton at his doore, askt something of him for gods</l> 
<l>cause. Tarlton putting his hand in his pocket, gaue him two </l>
<l>pence instead of a peny, at which Tarlton made this Rime: </l>
<l>Of</l>
<l></l>
<l>Of all other Beggers most happy thou art,</l>
<l>For to thee my hand is better then my heart.</l>
<l></l>
<l>Quoth the Begger.</l>
<l></l>
<l>True it is Master, as it chanceth now,</l>
<l>The better for me,and the worse for you.</l>
</lg>
					
<title>How Tarlton deceiued a Doctor of Phisicke.</title>
<lg>
<l>Tarlton to satisfie the humors of certaine Gentlemen, </l>
<l>his familiar acquaintance, went about for to try the </l>
<l>skill of a simple Doctor of Physicke, that dwelt not farre</l> 
<l>from Islington, and thus it was: hee tooke a faire Urinall, </l>
<l>and filled it halfe full of good wine, and bore it to this doctor,</l> 
<l>saying, it was a sicke mans water: who viewed it and tos-</l>
<l>sing it up and downe, as though he had great knowledge: </l>
<l>quoth he, the patient whose water it is, is full of grosse hu-</l>
<l>mors, and hath need of purging, and so be let some ten oun-</l>
<l>ces of blood. No you Dunce replyed Tarlton, it is good </l>
<l>pisse, and with that drunke it off, and threw the Urinall at</l> 
<l>his head.</l>
</lg>
					
<title>How Tarlton frighted a Country fellow.</title>
<lg>
<l>Tarlton passing through London, by chance hee heard a </l>
<l>simple Country fellow in an Ale-house, calling for a </l>
<l>(Kingstone?) pot of Ale, stept into him and threatened to accuse</l> 
<l>him of treason, saying: Sirra, I haue seene and tasted of a </l>
<l>penny pot of Ale, and haue found good of the price, but of </l>
<l>a Kingstone coine I neuer heard, therefore it is some coun-</l>
<l>terfait, and I must know how thou camest by it: hereupon </l>
<l>the Countrey fellow was driuen into such a maze, that out </l>
<l>of doores he got, and tooke him to his heeles, as though wilt-</l>
<l>fire had followed him.</l>
<l>How</l>
</lg>
					
<title>How Tarlton was deceived by his wife in London. </title>
<lg>
<l>Tarlton being merrily disposed, as his wife and he sate </l>
<l>together, he said unto her, Kate answere me to one que-</l>
<l>stion without a lye, and take this crowne of gold: which she</l> 
<l>tooke on condition, that if he lost, to restore it backe againe.</l> 
<l>Quoth Tarlton, am I a Cuckold or no Kate? Whereat she </l>
<l>answered not a word, but stood silent: notwithstanding he </l>
<l>urged her many waies: Tarlton seeing she would not speak, </l>
<l>askt his gold againe: why quoth she, haue I made any lye? </l>
<l>no sayes Tarlton: why then goodman foole I haue won the </l>
<l>wager: Tarlton mad with anger, made this Rime:</l>
<l></l>
<l>As women in speech can reuile a man,</l>
<l>So can they in silence beguile a man.</l>
</lg>

<title>One askt Tarlton what Countrey man the Diuell was. </title>
						
In Carter-lane dwelt a mery Cobler, who being in com-
pany with Tarlton, askt him what Countrey man the di-
uell was: quoth Tarlton, a Spaniard; for Spaniards like 
the Diuell, trouble the whole world.

<title>A Cheese-mongers question to Tarlton.</title>
						
In the time of Scarsitie, a simple Cheesemonger hearing 
Tarlton commended for his quick wit, came unto him, 
and asked him why he thought Cheese and Butter to be so deere: 
Tarlton answered, because Wood and Coles are so deere, for 
Butter and Cheese a man may eate without a fire.

<title>Tarltons answere to a rich Londiner. </title>
						
Tarlton meeting a rich Londiner, fell into talke about the 
	Bishop of Peterborough, highly praising his bounty 
	to
	to his seruants, his liberalitie to strangers, his great Hos-
	pitalitie and Charitie to the poore. He doth well sayes the 
	rich man, for what he hath is his but during his life. Why 
	quoth Tarlton, for how many liues haue you your goods?

<title>How Tarlton gaue away his dinner.</title>
						
As Tarlton and his wife sate at dinner, his wife being 
displeased with him, and thinking to crosse him, there 
gaue away halfe of his meat unto a poore Beggar, saying, 
take this for my other husbands sake. Whereupon Tarlton 
tooke all that was left, and likewise had the poore fellow to 
pray for his other wifes soule.

<title>Tarltons answere to a Boy in Rime. </title>
						
There was a crackrope Boy, meeting Tarltno in London 
street, sung this rime unto Tarlton.

Woeworth thee Tarlton,
That euer thou wast borne:
Thy wife hath made thee Cuckold,
And thou must weare the horne.

Tarlton presently answered him in Extemporie.

What and if I be (Boy)
I am nere the worse:
Shee keepes me like a Gentleman,
With money in my purse.

<title>How Tarlton bid himselfe to dinner 
to my Lord Mayors </title>

A Jest came in Tarltons head where to dine, and thought 
he, in all that a man does, let him ayme at the fairest, 
for
for sure if I bid myselfe any where this day, it shall be to 
my Lord Maiors: and upon this, goes to the Counter and 
entred his action against my Lord Maior, who was present-
ly told of it, and sends for him. Tarlton waits dinner time, 
and then comes, who was admitted presently. Master 
Tarlton, sayes my Lord Maior, haue you entred an action 
against me in the Poultry Counter? My Lord, sayes Tarl-
ton, haue you entred an action against me in Woodstreet 
Counter? Not I in troth, saies my Lord. No saies Tarlton, 
he was a villaine that told me so then: but if it be not so, for-
giue me this fault my Lord, and I will neuer offend in the 
next: but in the end he begins to sweare, how he will bee 
reuenged on him that mockt him, and flings out in a rage, 
But my Lord sayd, stay M. Tarlton, dine with me, and no 
doubt but after dinner you will be better minded. I will try 
that my Lord, saies Tarlton, and if it alter mine anger, both 
mine enemie &amp; I will thanke you together for this curtesie.

<title>Tarltons Iest of a box on the eare. </title>
						
One that fell out with his friend, meets him in the 
street, and calling him into a corner, gaue him a boxe 
on the eare, and feld him, getting him gone, and neuer told 
wherefore he did so: which Tarlton beholding, raised up the 
fellow, and askt him the reason of their suddaine falling 
out? can you tell Sir said the fellow, for by my troth as yet 
I cannot? Well said Tarlton, the more foole you, for had 
I such feeling of the cause, my wit would remember the in-
iurie, but many men are goslings, the more they feele the 
lesse they conceiue.

<title>Tarltons Iest to two Taylors. </title>
					
Tarlton meeting two Tailors (friends of his) in the eue-
ning, in mirth cryes, who goes there? A man answered 
a Taylor: how many is there? one: Yea said Tarlton, two 
said the other Taylor: then you say true, said Tarlton, for 
C	two
two Taylors goes to a man. But before they parted, they 
foxt Tarlton, at the Castle in Paternoster Row, that Tarlton 
confest them two Taylors to be honest men: so what they 
spent in the purse they got in the person: comming but one 
by Tarltons account, they returned two: but Tarlton com-
ming one, returned lesse by his wit, for that was shrunk in 
the whetting.

<title>How Tarlton iested at his wife. </title>
						
Tarlton and his wife keeping an Ordinarie in Pater-
noster Row, was bidden out to Supper, and because he 
was a man noted, she would not goe with him in the street, 
but intreats him to kepe one side and she another, which he 
contented to: but as he went he would cry out to her and say, 
Turne that way wife, and anon on this side wife: so the 
people flockt the more to laugh at them, but his wife more 
then mad angry, goes backe againe, and almost forswore 
his company.

<title>How Tarlton committed a Rakers horse to Ward. </title>
						
When Tarlton dwelt in Gracious street, at a Ta-
verne at the signe of the Saba, he was chosen Sca-
venger, and often the Ward complained of his slacknes in 
keeping the streets cleane: so on a time when the Cart came, 
he asked the Raker, why he did his businesse so slackly, Sir 
said he, my fore-horse was in the fault, who being let blood 
and drencht yesterday, I durst not labour him: sir said Tarl-
ton, your horse shall smart for it, and so leads him to the 
Counter, which the Raker laught at, and without his horse 
did his worke with the rest, thinking Tarltons humor was 
to iest, and would returne him his horse againe anon: but 
when that anon came, he was faine to pay all his fees of the 
prison, as directly as if he himselfe had beene there: for if 
Tarlton had committed the matter, the busines had not gone 
forward, therefore the horse was in prison for the Master.
How

<title>How Tarlton made Armin his adopted sonne 
						to succeed him.</title>
						
Tarlton keeping a Tauerne in Gracious street, hee let it 
to another, who was indebted to Armins Master, a Gold
smith in Lumbard street: yet he himselfe had a Chamber 
in the same house. And this Armin being then a wag came 
often thither to demaund his Masters money, which hee 
sometimes had, and sometimes had not: in the end the man 
growing poore, told the boy he had no money for his Master, 
and he must beare with him. The mans name being Char-
les, Armin made this verse, writing it with chalke on a 
white-scot (?):
O world how wilt thou lie, is this Charles the great?
	that I denie :
Indeed Charles the great before,
But now Charles the lesse, being poore.
Tarlton comming into the roome reading it, and partly ac-
quainted with the boyes humor, comming often thither for 
his M. money, tooke a piece of chalke, &amp; writ this rime by it.
A wag thou art, none can preuent thee,
And they defeat shall content thee :
Let me diuine, as I am, so in time thou'lt be the same.
My adopted sonne therefore be,
And see how it fell out: the Boy reading this, so loued Tarl-
ton after, that regarding him with more respect, used (?) to his 
playes, and fell in a league with his humour, and priuate 
practise brought him to present playing, and at this houre 
performs the same, where at the Globe on the Bancke-side 
men may see him.

<title>Tarltons greeting with Bankes his horse.</title>
					
There was one Bankes (in the time of Tarlton) who ser-
ued the Earle of Esser (?), &amp; had a horse of strange qualities: 
C 2	and
and being at the Crosse-keyes in Gracious streete, getting 
money with him (as he was mightily resorted to:) Tarlton 
then (with his fellowes) playing at the Bell by, came into 
the Crosse-keyes amongst many people) to see fashions : 
which Bankes perceiuing (to make the people laugh) sayes 
Signior (to his Horse) goe fetch mee the veriest foole in the 
company, the Jade comes immediatly, and with his mouth 
drawes Tarlton forth: Tarlton with merry words said no-
thing, but God a mercy Horse: in the end, Tarlton seeing 
the people laugh so, was angry inwardly, and said, Sir, had 
I power of your horse, as you haue, I would doe more then 
that. Where ere it be said Bankes (to please him) I will 
charge him to do it: then saies Tarlton, charge him to bring 
me the veriest whore-master in this company. He shall saies 
Bankes: Signior saies he, bring M. Tarlton heere the veriest 
Whoremaster in the company: the Horse leades his master 
to him: then God a mercy Horse indeed, sayes Tarlton:the 
people had much adoe to keepe peace, but Bancks &amp; Tarlton 
had like to squarde, and the horse by to giue ayme: but euer 
after it was a by-word through London, God a mercy horse, 
and is to this day.

<title>An excellent Iest of Tarlton suddenly spoken. </title>
						
At the Bull at Bishops-gate was a play of Henry the 
fift, wherein the Judge was to take a boxe on the eare, 
and because he was absent that should take the blow: Tarl-
ton himselfe (euer forward to please) tooke upon him to play 
the same Judge, besides his owne part of the Clowne: and 
Knell then playing Henry the fift, hit Tarlton a sound boxe 
indeed, which made the people laugh the more, because it 
was he: but anone the Judge goes in, &amp; immediately Tarl-
ton (in his Clownes clothes) comes out, and askes the Ac-
tors what newes? I faith-one, had it thou beene here, thou 
shouldst haue seene Prince Henry hit the Judge a terribly 
boxe on the eare: What man, said Tarlton, strike a Judge? 
It
It is true yfaith, said the other: no other like, said Tarlton, 
and it could not be but terrible to the Judge, when the re-
port so terrifies me, that me thinkes the blow remaines still 
on my cheeke, that it burnes againe. The people laught at 
this mightily, and to this day I haue heard it commended 
for rare: but no maruaile, for he had many of these. But 
I would see our Clownes in these dayes doe the like, no I 
warrant ye, and yet they thinke well of themselues too.

<title>Tarltons Iest with a Boy in the street. </title>

A Wag-halter Boy met Tarlton in the street, and said: 
Master Tarlton who liues longest? Marry Boy, sayes 
Tarlton, he that dies latest: and why die men so fast, said 
the Boy? because they want breath, said Tarlton: no ra-
ther said the Boy, because their time is come: then thy time 
is come, said Tarlton, see who comes yonder: Who? said the 
Boy: Marry said Tarlton, Bull the hangman: or one that 
would willingly be thy hangman: Nay, hang me then, if 
I employ him at this time, said the Boy. Well said Tarlton, 
then thou wilt be hanged by thy owne confession, and so they 
parted.

<title>A Iest of Tarlton, prouing Mustard to haue wit. </title>
	
Tarlton keeping an Ordinarie in Pater-noster row, and 
sitting with Gentlemen to make them merry, would ap-
proue Mustard, (standing before them) to haue wit: how so 
sayes one? It is like a witty skold, meeting another skold, 
knowing that skold will skold, begins to skold first, so saies 
he, the Mustard being lickt up, and knowing that you will 
bite it, begins to bite you first: Ile trie that saies a Gull by, 
and the Mustard so tickled him, that his eyes watered: how 
now sayes Tarlton, does my Iest fauour? I, saiaes the Gull, 
and bite too: if you had had better wit, sayes Tarlton, you 
would haue bit first: so then conclude with me, that dumbe 
C 3	unfeeling

unfeeling Mustard, hath more wit than a talking unfeeling 
foole as you are. Some were pleased and some were not, 
but all Tarltons care was taken (for his resolution was such 
euer) before he talkt any Iest.

<title>How Tarlton tooke Tobacco at the first comming 
	vp of it.</title>

Tarlton (as other Gentlemen Used) at the first comming 
by of Tobacco, did take it more for fashions sake then 
otherwise, and being in a roome, set betweene two men o-
uercome with wine, and they neuer seeing the like, wondred 
at it, and seeing the vapour come out of Tarltons nose, cried 
out fire, fire, and threw a cup of wine in Tarltons face: 
Make no more stiree quoth Tarlton, the fire is quenched, if 
the Sheriffes come it will turne to a fine, as the custome 
is. And drinking that againe, fie sayes the other, what a 
stincke it makes, I am almost poisoned: If it offend, sayes 
Tarlton, lets euery one take a little of the smell, and 
so the sauour will quickly goe: but To-
bacco whiffes made them leaue 
him to pay all.
